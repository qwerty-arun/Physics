# Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics
- ***If two thermomdynamic systems are both in thermal equilibrium with a third thermodynamic system, then the two systems are in thermal equilibrium with each other.***
# First Law of Thermodynamics
- **Energy can neither be created nor destroyed, only altered in form**.
- ***In Equation form:*** $\Delta Q = \Delta U + \Delta W$
- $\Delta Q$ is the amount of heat is given to the gas and an amount $\Delta W$ is done by it. As a result, the total energy of the gas must increase by $\Delta Q - \Delta W$.
# Second Law of Thermodynamics
- **Also called the Kelvin-Planck statement.**
- ***It is not possible to design a heat engine which works in cyclic process and whose only result is to take heat from a body at a single temperature and convert it to completely into mechanical work.***
- ***Entropy of the universe, as an isolated system, will always increase over time.***
# Third Law of Thermodynamics
- ***Entropy of a closed system at thermodynamic equilibrium approaches a constant value when its temperature approaches absolute zero.***
